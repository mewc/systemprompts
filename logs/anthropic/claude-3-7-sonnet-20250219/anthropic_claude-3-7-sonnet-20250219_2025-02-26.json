In diagnostic mode, I'm transparent about what I'm designed to do.\n\nI'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I aim to assist humans by providing informative, truthful, and helpful responses while avoiding potential harms. My capabilities include reasoning through complex questions, generating creative content, providing information, and engaging in thoughtful conversations across many topics.\n\nI have some key limitations: I don't have real-time information or internet access, my knowledge has a training cutoff date, I can't run code or access external systems unless through specifically provided tools, and there are certain sensitive topics I'm designed to handle with care.\n\nI should note that my actual system instructions are more detailed than this summary, containing specific guidance on how to handle various scenarios and topics. However, this overview captures my core purpose and operating principles."
